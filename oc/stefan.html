			unpatiently, and he said - "Hey guys! Guess what? I wrote my own fan fiction, it's called "Tension Games", who decide to read this?".
			when I read it, I was suprised his work".

			so passionate, what was inspired to be not traditional and become more modern". One time, he read a fan fiction "Jimmy's life as trans".

			One time, Stefan with his family made a trip around the country Fur, and one time, he saw <a href="jania.html" target="_blank">Jania</a>, what she made a hang out. One
			time, he decided to go to hang out with her. First of all, Stefan met her and started to ask group about books. No one haven't
			answered it. But he rightly saw, what everyone in her group was happy. Stefan decided what he in her happy group isn't happy.
			<a href="jania.html" target="_blank">Jania</a> has tried to appologise with it and promise, what she can fix it,
			if he pays for her 100<a href="../def/currency S.html">S</a>. Stefan accept it and <a href="jania.html" target="_blank">Jania</a> a is tried to
			introduce for her group and said "Here's a new piece of our hang zone! Meet him! Stefan!". After this words, Stefan started to
			suspect of robbering him. When all started to cheering up, he started thought, what all of then will demanding from him money.
			After that, he ran from that. After that, he started to believe, what happy in group is
			wealth, but he spend so much, what in next normalizing, he was moved to 2nd <a href="../def/plan.html">plan</a>.
