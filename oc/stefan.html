			and he decided to read some books. It was an adventure books. Stefan was so impressed, what decided to write funfictions and share it
			with a group of fanats of books. They liked it, and Stefan started a writer career. Gray - "When Stefan is going to us, he was so
			unpatiently, and he said - "Hey guys! Guess what? I wrote my own funfiction, it's called "Tension Games", who decide to read this?".
			when I read it, I was suprised his work".

			He also read some funfictions of adventure books by fanats of books with non-traditional relationship. Stefan - "They was
			so passionate, what was inspired to be not traditional and become more modern". One time, he read a funcfiction "Jimmy's life as trans".
			Stefan - "The funfiction is looks for me a little confused, like, "why Jimmy is looking for men and then is going to date with him?".
			When explained this, then I want to be a different, to be more cute and live with attraction".

			answered it. But he rightly saw, what everyone in her group was happy. Stefan decided what he in her happy group isn't happy.
			<a href="jania.html" target="_blank">Jania</a> has tried to appologise with it and promise, what she can fix it, if he pays for her 100<a href="../def/currency S.html">S</a>.

			After this words, Stefan started to suspect of robbering him. When all started to cheering up, he started thought, what all of
			then will demanding from him money. After that, he ran from that. After that, he started to believe, what happy in group is
			wealth, but he spend so much, what in next normalizing, he was moved to 2nd <a href="../def/plan.html">plan</a>.
