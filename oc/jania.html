			Jania loves to make friends. She has above 10 friends. Jania joined to hanging sessions 8 times on average for a week.
			But not all her friends trusted her, Diana was the riches person in sessions, and every single time, Jania tried to get a money from her.
			Diana - "Jania wants my money, I don't know, what's methodes she decide to take money from me. I was scared, when Jania was appeared in clothes shop".

			She loves to travel around the country Anime, because, Jania was there, when she had 14 years old. Jania was so impressed with it, what decided
			to travel with her friends, but she hasn't enought of money for that.

			Jania loves to be in the center of the attention. It because she loves to get attention and be accepted. When someone is
			in the center of the attention, then she's trying to be near the object of public attention. Some Jania's friends says,
			what "If you see something Intresting, then she will appear nearby".

			Jania sometimes can tell her friends about investiments. She think, what this should be intresting for her friends, especially
			for Mitchell. Mitchell - "That's why I'm still be friend with Jania, she can tell me about the investiment world and cheer me to
			make my first investiment".
		</p>
		<p>
			One time, Jania decided to visit <a href="kiwuar.html" target="_blank">Kiwuar</a>, with her friends, but, unfortunatly, nobody didn't accept to visit him. Jania started to argue with
			her friends. It's because nobody wanted to visit Kiwuar "Why we should go to the <a href="kiwuar.html" target="_blank">Kiwuar</a>? He's soo boring. Moreover, he suggest us to go to a
			plain, and that's disgusting..." but she didn't listened them. Jania - "Are you going to regect him, as my friend, I think no".
