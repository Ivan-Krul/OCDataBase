		<h2>"Plan defenition of Wealth"</h2>
		<p>
			This is a system of definition person's wealth, invented in country Lib and globalized almost everywhere, except: W, ESC, Defense, LMem and Resource.
			There're a lot of levels of the plan, from 0th(with the most wealth) to 5th(with the least wealth).
			Each level has a border of incoming profit and max capacity of reserved money.
			If a person crossed the one of the condition, then it's level would change. In every country is own system of subsides for bigger level of plan.
			Every year, plan is normalizing.
