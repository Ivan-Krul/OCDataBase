				At childhood, Ostafan got leader traits.
				He tried to play in team games like football(soccer) or volleyball, but activity wasn't for him.
				Ostafan was intrested in card games like mafia, and in common thread.
				He was so confidence, what Ostafan can make friends easily.
				Ostafan's mother, Ruby - "He had a lot of friends. Every week, my son met a new friend and tried to met him with me".
				His friend, August - "Ostafan looks like sun. Yes not literaly, but you can imagine, how muck rays can he emit".
			</p>
			<p>
				In school, he studied well. At least, Ostafan can ask someone to help.
				He also saw his little brother, called Ashton.
				Ashton - "He was clever. I remember, what Ostafan sat for studying whole darktime".
			</p>
			<p>
				One time, Ostafan met <a href="jania.html" target="_blank">Jania</a>. They had dialogue.
				Ostafan(speaks happy) - "Hi! What's your name?"
				Jania(calm) - "Hello. Jania. What about you?"
				Ostafan - "Ostafan, nice to meet you!"
				Jania - "U too!"
				Ostafan - "Why are you not so happy?"
				Jania - "I'm not so happy as you"
				Ostafan - "Ok, then what's your hobby?"
				Jania - "Trades. I can assume, what you don't know what is that"
				Ostafan - "Yeah, that's true, but friendship and teaming up is my potential. And if you want a friend or a leader, you can contact me!"
				Jania - "I have a lot of friends. Do you have?"
				Ostafan - "Of course! Are you want some?"
				Jania - "I don't think so. Last time, I'm so busy..."
				Ostafan - "What do you think about merging our groups?"
				Jania - "Then let it happen"
