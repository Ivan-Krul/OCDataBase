				Ukinas was born in average family. Her mother, Mary, worked in SN. Her dad, Isaac, was with her. Ukinas was happy, all time, when her mom came.
				She told her about tolerance to special group of people, but also told, what she is also special for them.
			</p>
			<p>
				When Ukinas started go to school, she rised up questions like "Why should we doing not same all time, like see a dilema and taking a weapon?"
				Ukinas got a friend called Mia, what was in LGBT group.
				Ukinas got interested in the group, like
				"Do I want actually going to date with boys, what is so stereotyped?
				Do I want to feel a threat from them when I'll brake up with them?
				Do I want a stereotyped boyfriend what wanted just have sex with anyone?
				No! I want to be a unique person and don't envy"
				Mia - "She was so courageous, what decided to ask very sensitive questions. Ukinas also wanted to be with me in one group.
				She decided to be asexual, but honestly, maybe I'm going to fall in love with her"
			</p>
			<p>
				One time, she saw a poster to hiring to W for influence the enviroument to the bright side.
				Ukinas decided to get a job. When she arrived to the W, she saw a blue forest from bonzai.
				When she arrived to the castle, Ukinas was recognised and they offered well payed work for activism.
				She was agreed.
