			<p>Traits: Cheerful (mainly to family), Introverty (in crowded places), Creative (in his arts), Lazy (at home)</p>
			<p>
				Mother of Kiwuar, Julia sometimes cooked for him a spagetti. It's his favourite dish. Kiwuar - "The dish fills my heart tomatoes and flavour of basil...".
			</p>
			<p>
				His family wanted to be in the calm places, such as: forests, valleys, etc. Father of Kiwuar, Frank - "I think, what nature is more beautiful,
				when you don't see a voidness".
			</p>
			<p>
				He wanted go to Art school because his friend Kevin told, what in country Edu is good art school,
				but, unfortunatly, the country was captured by Island coalition. After a revenge war with Island coalition and Contin's union,
				the coalition was broke down and formed a lot of new countries like Art or &lt;/&gt;. He remembered, what he wanted to get to
				Art school, and decided to learn closier to home.
			</p>
			<p>
				He met <a href="jania.html" target="_blank">Jania</a>, when Kiwuar was in secondary school. She was in local trade school, but sometimes at breaks, she sneak to school, where was
				Kiwuar for hanging out with her friends. When Kiwuar saw her, he don't paid attention to her, but when <a href="jania.html" target="_blank">Jania</a> saw him, then in
				his school table was letter by her. Letter - "Hello, dear IDK what's your name. I think, what you are soo sleepy... Can you join to my hanging session?
				Hide your letter under the school table. - <a href="jania.html" target="_blank">Jania</a>". When he read the letter, Kiwuar decided to join to the session.
				Kiwuar - "She looks calm and brave to call me to a school lunch".
			</p>
			<p>
				One time, at Valentine cycle, he got a love letter. He was shocked with it, because he don't know who was writed the letter.
				Kiwuar asked <a href="jania.html" target="_blank">Jania</a> about it and she didn't write the letter for him. He started to ask eveyone in the school for the letter.
				Kiwuar has found <a href="alexa.html" target="_blank">Alexa</a>, what accepted, what she has writed the letter.
				Both started to act nervous, because he didn't expected about attraction from random person, and she was attaracted to Kiwuar and thought a lot.
				There're hardly talked about the letter, but lately she started to saying to him, what she feels attraction to him.
				Everyone, who was nearby heared about this.
				Kiwuar - "<a href="alexa.html" target="_blank">Alexa</a> told me, what I was at her attention and when she saw me, then <a href="alexa.html" target="_blank">Alexa</a> started to spectate for him a lot of time,
				but I didn't trust her, and said "Ok, that was intense, bye!". But <a href="alexa.html" target="_blank">Alexa</a> started to chasing me, that was scared. But unfortunatly,
				she got me, and I was in difficult situation, she surrounded me near the wall. You can imagine me as scared, and that's true.
				She started to flirting me very tense. But thanfully, the lesson was started, and at the next break I escaped from the school"
				<i>[Yeah, unconnectable relationships, just it was a situation, when she was there before reattach to another school]</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				One time, he walked with <a href="jania.html" target="_blank">Jania</a>'s hang group. One time, he walked to [undefined town]. Kiwuar saw the bridge,
				but why is it? He was gone to check it out. Kiwuar saw voidness under it. He first thought, what it's valley, and said this to group. When Kiwuar
				told them about that, they accidently stated laugh. Hang group told a reason, why they had laugh. Kiwuar couldn't believe, what all is just
				floating islands. Even after walk, he still can't believe. Lately he accepted the fact. Kiwuar - "It... I don't know how could even possible.
				We have a gravity force, but why islands isn't falling down?".
			</p>
			<p>
				One time, he heard something very far. He was shocked of it, and they hid in the home. Later, It was so different with countryside,
				it was only field with no trees, and with holes. After one cycle, someone has come, it was census taker, and he said - "Howdy, we're from
				cental goverment of Lang, and we have an object to take a data from population of the region." Kiwuar's mother Julia - "Really?! Are we actually
				in Lang?" - "Of course we are! Our country for defensive oportunity occupied the region temporary." After sharing theirs' data, he left them and
				no longer he didn't come. In the next cycle, it was same, as a cycle earlier. There was even explotions and crushes some structures. After some cycles,
				it was quite, and they're saw, what ships was destroyed. Some buildings nearby was destroyed. It was tensitive moments, Kiwuar's mom Julia was scared,
				and even Kiwuar was changed. He was exhausted, with no energy to create anything and he was silent. Sometimes he even cried. One time, after 4 cycles,
				he was so tired, what he asked his mom to go outside. He later disappeared from ruins of the village. [More details what was about is
