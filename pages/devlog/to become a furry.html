		<h2>Devlog of Kiwuar</h2>
		<p>
			Before, I drew humans and one <a href="../../image/I've ruined, cuz have paws.png">cat</a>. Even I say, what I
			shamed furries early. But one time, I saw in Discord one meme like "Average furry", and showed a thumpnail and title of one video in
			YouTube called "How to interact with furry haters and not furries". I had intrested in what their solution, and started to watch
			more and more video related with it. I wanted to be a furry, because it develop in me community skills and creative skills.
			So decided to start to draw my sona. As reference I took my cat, called <a href="../../image/Kusya.jpg">Kusya</a>.
			After drawing, I started to become a furry. So here am I.
